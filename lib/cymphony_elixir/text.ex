  Replaces secret-shaped content in `value` with `[REDACTED]`.

  A failing agent CLI routinely prints its own environment. Two paths carry
  that output off the box, and both call this: the retained failure tail
  (retry entry, `/api/v1/state`, dashboard retry queue, tracker abandonment
  comment) and the live harness stdout ring (`GET /api/v1/:issue/harness` and
  the dashboard harness pane). The local debug transcript on disk
  (`~/.cymphony/log/cymphony.log.N`, written by the runner's own stream logger)
  is deliberately **not** redacted — it never leaves the host, and an operator
  debugging an auth failure needs the real bytes.

  Redacted shapes:

  * assignments — `NAME=value`, `NAME => value`, `NAME: value`,
    `"NAME": "value"`, `"NAME" => "value"` — whose name has a whole
    `KEY`/`TOKEN`/`SECRET`/`PASSWORD`/`PASSWD`/`PAT`/`CREDENTIAL`/
    `AUTHORIZATION`/`COOKIE` segment, a camelCase spelling of one
    (`apiKey`, `authToken`, `clientSecret`, …), or a compound `PWD`. The name
    is kept so the diagnostic still says *which* variable was involved.
  * `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers, to end of line, with or without a
    scheme — `Bearer`, `Basic`, or none — because the scheme is not the secret.
  * bare credentials with a known vendor prefix: `sk-`, `lin_api_`, `gh[pousr]_`,
    `github_pat_`, `xox<a>-`, `AIza`, `ya29.`, `1//`, JWTs, `AKIA`, `npm_`, `hf_`.

  Two deliberate carve-outs keep diagnostics readable, because the messages
  this protects are the ones operators most need:

  * the bare `NAME: value` form requires a **compound** name, so
    `token: rate limit exceeded`, `Unexpected token: '<'`, and
    `KeyError: key: :model` survive intact. `NAME=value` and the quoted forms
    still accept a single-segment name.
  * a name ending in `_PATH`, `_FILE`, `_DIR`, `_ID`, or `_NAME` keeps its
    value: `SSH_KEY_PATH=/home/me/.ssh/id_rsa` names a location, not a secret.

  This is a redactor, not a secret scanner: an opaque high-entropy string with
  no name and no known prefix still passes through. Ordinary output — URLs,
  code, hex identifiers, words that merely contain "key" — is left alone.

  Cost is superlinear in line length on segmented input, so callers on a hot
  path cap the line first (`truncate_trailing_bytes/2`); port lines can reach
  1 MB.
